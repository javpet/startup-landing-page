# startup-landing-page
I've created a responsive startup landing page with HTML, CSS-only, feel free to use it for future projects.

The main purpose of the creation was, that I felt many times during hackathons that I'm re-doing the same structure to showcase the project, so I decided to create a quick template for myself. You can have a preview of the landing page template [here](https://javpet.github.io/startup-landing-page/).
